# SPARQL query integration - Ontology

## üìù Description
The purpose of this project is to implement a Java program for converting and storing a dataset from IMDb into an RDF graph. The data is available on e-learning and includes:
The program will utilize RML (RDF Mapping Language) to define the mapping rules between the input data and the RDF graph representation. The converted RDF data will be stored in a GraphDB and managed using RDF4J, a Java library for working with RDF data. This project aims to facilitate semantic querying and analysis of IMDb data by transforming it into a linked data format and leveraging the capabilities of GraphDB and RDF4J.

## üìö Dataset

  * actors.json
  * movies.tsv
  * ratings.tsv


### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### start GraphDB:

   * Download the GraphDB distribution package from the official website (e.g., graphdb-free-9.0.0-dist.zip).
   *  Unzip the package to a desired location on your system.
   *  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the GraphDB installation directory.

### start GraphDB:

  *  Execute the following command to start GraphDB:
    
```bash
./bin/graphdb

```
    
  *  GraphDB will start running and can be accessed through a web browser at ** http://localhost:7200.**
